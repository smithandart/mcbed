Have you ever wanted to make a Minecraft bed texture pack for wholesome reasons?



1.  Rename your custom images to the same file name as the bed you want to modify
    -   Images should have a transparent background, but isn't required
    -   Images should have a centered subject (will be cropped to 256x512 centered), but isn't required
    -   Look at the original_beds file names for reference
2.  Run main.py
    -   Needs [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) recommended 3.13 or greater
    -   Needs [Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation/basic-installation.html) recommended 11.3.0 or greater
    -   Using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) would be easier, but not required
3.  Copy modified beds to textures/entity/bed directory to replace beds in your texture pack
